# Ultra_Mini_Lighting
I'm mostly just putting these up due to a request. They were an offshoot version specifically for my game aiming to be much more lightweight and efficient. As such one for MZ is up to date, but the MV one is quite ancient as I haven't really done anything with it in ages after switching engines.

Just as with Community Lighting I invite others to submit changes or updates, just keep in mind the point of this one is to be lightweight and efficient. If youâ€™re looking for a more feature rich version, I invite you to look into Community Lighting instead.
